# Sort

Given a sequence of integers, it's your task to sort them ascendingly. Of course, you could just use the build in sorting methods, but that would be lame.

The input starts with an integern representing the numer of lines that follow. Each line is one testcase. Each testcase starts with a number representing the number of ints following. You shall sorts these ints and output a single line, containg them in ascending order, separated by a single space.

Example input:

    3
    3 0 3 2
    5 1 2 3 4 5
    8 10 10 7 6 10 10 999 43 42 44
    
Example output:

    0 2 3
    1 2 3 4 5
    6 7 10 10 10 10 42 43 44 999
