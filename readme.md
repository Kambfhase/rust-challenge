# The Rust Challenge

The best way to learn a new programming language is to program. So I compiled this repo containing challenges for me and others to solve. Open an issue if you think something is missing.

## The Challenges

Each challenge consists of a file with the instructions. This is usually a markdown or PDF file. Challenges can also have an `in.txt` and `out.txt` file. When you program is given the input it is expectet to generate the given output. Correct solutions may be filed into the `solutions` folder.
